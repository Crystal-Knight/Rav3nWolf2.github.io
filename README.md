## Description
My Portfolio


# Purpose
The purpose of my portfolio is to showcase my abilities, personality, previous work for future employers and my own personal benift. 


# Functionality / features
Features include a navigation bar to switch to different parts of the portfolio, when considering the site layout, I thought this would be best for visual reasons and to not overcrowd one page.
The portfolio is reactive in all screen sizes on all pages. 
there is also external links to pages such as Instagram and my blog as well as GitHub and LinkedIn for contact purposes.


### Sitemap

The site contains four separations placed in a nav bar atop the page.

1. About me
2. Projects
3. Education
4. Contact

# Target audience:
The audience I would be targeting with my portfolio is future employers.


# Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)
Tech stack used is HTML, CSS and some bootstrap components, and the deployment platform, GitHub pages


# Design process

Wire frames were the beginning of the project as they set the foundation of how I wanted my page to look, next was getting the basic components laid down such as, creating the different VS files to separate code for a cleaner result, then colour and images followed.

After a few mishaps with responsive pages I decided to make a few changes to the code. As placement on desktop vs responsive where not to my liking.

I focused on functionality rather than big glitz and glam, also as I prefer pages that don’t have to much distraction and you can do what you need to do and leave. Therefore usability and the functionally where more my primary focus.

# Usability considerations

The usability considerations were more around colours and contrast, there are no colours that could potentially affect colour-blindness.

# Short Answer Q&A - Include short answers to the following questions,
1. Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)

Some of the key events since the 1980’s include the use of the word Internet, which was used for the first time is 1982. Another milestone is the DNS system which came into play in 1984 giving the us such things as .com, .org and .Edu. 
As for the development in how we use the internet in an ever increasing number since 1996 has flooded the servers from 45 million people to over 7 billion as of 2017.
We also have the beginning of, YouTube, myspace, google. among many other popular sites today that have influenced the 21st century’s internet platform and usage.



2.  Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

For a fully functional website all of these components must be deployed, a domain, DNS or Domain Name Server, web Servers and web browsers. A domain is under the control of a registry from which you would have to purchase to have control of. A DNS or Domain Name Sever is the equivalent to a IP address and easier for Humans to remember then a string of numbers. A web server is a combination of hardware and software, the hardware holds all the files needed  for a website to display all the input a user sees, and the software at a minimum is a user protocol such as a HTTP. And lastly, a web browser is a program such as Fire-Fox. 

3.  Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)

Influence, the internet has changed the way we are influenced in both good and bad aspects, it can be used to create change and awareness or it can be used to create hate and ignite fear and destruction. As with anything there is good and bad in everything that we do, think or see. 
And in many ways the internet has changed the way we look, think and see things, as it doesn’t always portray the truth and people can be mislead by such things. I believe there can be benefit to the internet but it is not always a good benefit.

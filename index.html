        <p> Hey! Good to see you here, my name is Crystal ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m 24 for now, and I love all things creative.
            I am going to be a front end developer! isnt that great? I am currently studying.
            front end atrracts be as creative things have always had a big influence in my life and passions
            As both a female and member of the LGBTIQA+ community I have always found myself looking out for the
            underdog.
            Tech had always drawn me in from a young age (it has nothing to do with being a millennial ðŸ˜‰)
            I was always intrigued by video games, the way things were put together such as toasters.
            Therefore tech was always something that was drawn to me and so it made sense to divulge into the IT
            industry.

                    One of the most important things for me whether it be in work or everyday life is the ability to be
                    myself. <br>
                    clichÃ© or not, but you only live once, and to hide my personality from the world is not something I
                    wish to do. <br>

                    "We always take the little things for granted and then the bigger things seem impossible, to live
                    in the shadows, is to live without light and Iâ€™m afraid of the dark, so let me shine"
